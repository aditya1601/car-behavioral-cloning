## Project Description

In this project, I use a neural network to clone car driving behavior.  It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.  

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the center, the left and the right of the car).  

The network is based on [The NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been proven to work in this problem domain.

As image processing is involved, the model is using convolutional layers for automated feature engineering.  

### Files included

- model.py The script used to create and train the model.
- drive.py The script to drive the car. You can feel free to resubmit the original drive.py or make modifications and submit your modified version.
- utils.py The script to provide useful functionalities (i.e. image preprocessing and augumentation)
- bestmodel.h5 The model weights.
- environments.yml conda environment (Use TensorFlow without GPU)
- environments-gpu.yml conda environment (Use TensorFlow with GPU)

Note: drive.py is originally from [the Udacity Behavioral Cloning project GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3) but it has been modified to control the throttle.

## Quick Start

### Install required python libraries:

To use the tensorflow-gpu, you need compatible versions of CUDA drivers and CUDnn.

```python
# Dependencies can be installed using these commands. 
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter opencv3 pillow scikit-learn scikit-image scipy h5py eventlet flask-socketio seaborn pandas imageio moviepy tensorflow-gpu keras
```

### Run the pretrained model

Start up [the Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose the 2nd scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python drive.py bestmodel.h5
```

### To train the model

You'll need the data folder which contains the training images.

```python
python model.py <relative-path-to-image-folder>
```

This will generate a file `model-<epoch>.h5` whenever the performance in the epoch is better than the previous best.  For example, the first epoch will generate a file called `model-000.h5`.

## Model Architecture Design

The design of the network is based on [the NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been used by NVIDIA for the end-to-end self driving test.  As such, it is well suited for the project.  

It is a deep convolution network which works well with supervised image classification / regression problems.  As the NVIDIA model is well documented, I was able to focus how to adjust the training images to produce the best result with some adjustments to the model to avoid overfitting and adding non-linearity to improve the prediction.

I've added the following adjustments to the model. 

- I used Lambda layer to normalized input images to avoid saturation and make gradients work better.
- I've added an additional dropout layer to avoid overfitting after the convolution layers.
- I've also included ELU for activation function for every layer except for the output layer to introduce non-linearity.

In the end, the model looks like as follows:

- Image normalization
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 24, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 36, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 48, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
- Drop out (0.5)
- Fully connected: neurons: 100, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:  50, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:  10, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:   1 (output)

As per the NVIDIA model, the convolution layers are meant to handle feature engineering and the fully connected layer for predicting the steering angle.  However, as stated in the NVIDIA document, it is not clear where to draw such a clear distinction.  Overall, the model is very functional to clone the given steering behavior.  

The below is an model structure output from the Keras which gives more details on the shapes and the number of parameters.

## Data Preprocessing

### Image Sizing

- the images are cropped so that the model won’t be trained with the sky and the car front parts
- the images are resized to 160x320 (3 YUV channels).
- the images are normalized (image data divided by 127.5 and subtracted 1.0).  As stated in the Model Architecture section, this is to avoid saturation and make gradients work better)


## Model Training

### Image Augumentation

For training, I used the following augumentation technique along with Python generator to generate unlimited number of images:

- Randomly choose right, left or center images.
- For left image, steering angle is adjusted by +0.2
- For right image, steering angle is adjusted by -0.2
- Randomly flip image left/right
- Randomly translate image horizontally with steering angle adjustment (0.002 per pixel shift)
- Randomly translate image virtically
- Randomly added shadows
- Randomly altering image brightness (lighter or darker)

Using the left/right images is useful to train the recovery driving scenario.  The horizontal translation is useful for difficult curve handling (i.e. the one after the bridge).


## Training, Validation and Test

I splitted the images into train and validation set in order to measure the performance at every epoch.  Testing was done using the simulator.

As for training, 

- I used mean squared error for the loss function to measure how close the model predicts to the given steering angle for each image.
- I used Adam optimizer for optimization with learning rate of 1.0e-4 which is smaller than the default of 1.0e-3.  The default value was too big and made the validation loss stop improving too soon.
- I used ModelCheckpoint from Keras to save the model only if the validation loss is improved which is checked for every epoch.

### The Jungle Track (Track 2)

I generated the training data by using the mouse to steer the car for 5 rounds. Then I trained the model for just 1 epoch without any recovery scenario. The result can be seen as 'bestmodel.h5'. I wanted to show how a minimal amount of training can result in such a good model.

## Outcome

The model can drive on Track 2 (Jungle) with only 1 or 2 manual input.
